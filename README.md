# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

This project provides a **web-based dashboard** to analyze sentiment and user satisfaction for Instagram posts and comments. It uses **Flask**, **Pandas**, and **TextBlob** for sentiment analysis and categorization.

The application includes two main dashboards:

1. **Instagram QoS Dashboard**: Analyzes Instagram comments and displays average sentiment and user satisfaction statistics.
2. **Twitter QoS Dashboard** (planned for future implementation): Will display similar metrics for Twitter comments.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python used to build the web application.
* **Pandas**: A powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python.
* **TextBlob**: A Python library for processing textual data and performing sentiment analysis.
* **HTML, CSS**: Used for front-end development to create a responsive, user-friendly dashboard.

## Project Structure

The project is organized in the following folder structure:

```
/social_media_sentiment_analysis
│
├── /app.py                # Main Flask application file
├── /analysis.py           # Sentiment analysis and satisfaction classification logic
├── /templates/
│   ├── dashboard.html     # Instagram dashboard HTML template
│   └── twitter_dashboard.html  # Twitter dashboard HTML template (future implementation)
├── /static/
│   └── style.css          # Custom CSS for dashboard styling
└── /data/
    └── Instagram-datasets.csv  # Instagram dataset for analysis
```

## Requirements

To run the project, install the following dependencies:

* **Flask**: `pip install flask`
* **Pandas**: `pip install pandas`
* **TextBlob**: `pip install textblob`

---

## Setup

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure you have the dataset file:

   * `Instagram-datasets.csv`: This file contains Instagram comments data, located in the `data/` folder.

   **Instagram Dataset Columns**:

   * **comment**: The comment text.
   * **likes\_number**: The number of likes on the comment.
   * **replies\_number**: The number of replies to the comment.
   * **comment\_user**: Username of the user who made the comment.
   * **comment\_date**: Date when the comment was posted.

---

## Running the Application

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and visit:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/
   ```

   This will load the **Instagram QoS Dashboard**, displaying:

   * **Average Sentiment**: The average sentiment score calculated for all Instagram comments.
   * **Satisfaction Statistics**: A breakdown of comments classified as 'Positive', 'Neutral', or 'Negative' based on sentiment and engagement (likes and replies).

---

## Explanation of the Output

The Instagram dashboard provides an analysis of the comments based on the following metrics:

1. **Average Sentiment**:

   * This score reflects the overall sentiment of the comments. It is calculated using **TextBlob**'s sentiment analysis, which assigns a sentiment polarity score to each comment. The average sentiment score of all comments is shown on the dashboard. The polarity score ranges from `-1` (negative) to `1` (positive), with `0` indicating neutral sentiment.
2. **Satisfaction Statistics**:

   * Comments are classified into three categories: **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative**. The classification is based on a combination of sentiment score, the number of **likes**, and **replies**.

     * **Positive**: Comments with high sentiment scores and a relatively higher number of likes and replies.
     * **Neutral**: Comments with a sentiment score close to `0`, indicating neutral sentiment.
     * **Negative**: Comments with low sentiment scores and lower engagement.

   The dashboard shows the count of comments falling into each satisfaction category.

## Instagram CSV Implementation

The core functionality for Instagram sentiment analysis involves reading the dataset from the CSV file `Instagram-datasets.csv`. The steps involved are:

1. **Reading the CSV File**: The file is read using **Pandas** to load the dataset into a DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Renaming columns for consistency.
   * Dropping rows with missing comments to ensure accuracy in analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:

   * Using **TextBlob** to analyze the sentiment of each comment. The sentiment polarity score is used to classify each comment as either **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.

4. **Satisfaction Classification**:

   * Based on the sentiment score, number of likes, and replies, comments are classified into **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** categories.

5. **Displaying Results**:

   * The calculated **average sentiment** and **satisfaction statistics** are passed to the `dashboard.html` template, which renders the results in the web interface.

## Sample Instagram CSV Format

The `Instagram-datasets.csv` file should have the following columns:

| comment                  | likes\_number | replies\_number | comment\_user | comment\_date | ... |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --- |
| "Great post!"            | 120           | 10              | user1         | 2025-05-01    | ... |
| "This is amazing!"       | 200           | 15              | user2         | 2025-05-02    | ... |
| "Not bad, could improve" | 50            | 5               | user3         | 2025-05-03    | ... |

---

## Future Implementation

1. **Twitter QoS Dashboard**:

   * The logic for Twitter analysis will be similar to Instagram, but with Twitter-specific datasets (e.g., likes, retweets, and replies).
2. **Data Visualizations**:

   * Enhance the dashboard by adding **charts** and **graphs** (e.g., pie charts for satisfaction breakdown, bar charts for sentiment distribution).
